        <h1>~Goats Milk~</h1>
        Milk has been used by people for centuries as a skin softening beauty treatment. Cleopatra was known to have bathed in it. Now Scientists report that it is the alpha hydroxy acids in Goats Milk, & proteins specific to it, which rejuvenate, & soften the
        skin.
        <h1>Tallow/Lard</h1>
        Our Goats Milk soaps are all made with Tallow, which makes the most wonderful soap imaginable! It is rich and creamy, long lasting, moisturizing, and according to our customers, skin softening! You can feel the difference on your skin the very first time
