        <h1>~Goats Milk~</h1>
        Milk has been used by people for centuries as a skin softening beauty treatment. Cleopatra was known to have bathed in it. Now Scientists report that it is the alpha hydroxy acids in Goats Milk, & proteins specific to it, which rejuvenate, & soften the
        skin.
