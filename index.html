        <h1>Laurelstone Soaps</h1>
        <p>
            Uplift the mood and conjure up images of the beautiful plants and flowers in nature Nothing, can compare with holding one of these beautiful, handcrafted soaps in your hand. The creamy goodness of each one springs to life beneath running water, & is like
            receiving a skin softening gift from Mother Nature herself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our soaps contain a luscious blend of ingredients discovered, tried and tested during a lifelong love affair with the age old, natural process of soap making. More and more people, burdened by the stress of life and a desire to connect with Nature, are
            seeking unprocessed, sustainable products. They want a product which made with love, and the expertise of one who has passion for their craft. Working toward that end since 1986, our ingredients have been carefully selected and lovingly designed..
        </p>
        <h1>They include:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="soaps/goats_milk.html "> Goats Milk </a>, hailed for centuries as a beauty treatment to rejuvenate and soften skin.
